# TotalBeasts — PoEHelper Plugin

A [PoEHelper / ExileCore](https://github.com/exApiTools/ExileCore) plugin for Path of Exile that tracks, prices and automatically processes captured beasts in the Bestiary.

---

## Features

### Beast Tracking
- Highlights rare (red) beasts on the **world map** and in **3D world space** with their poe.ninja price
- Tracks **yellow beasts** (generic capturable monsters not in the named database) separately
- Color-coded by beast family: Vivid (yellow), Wild (pink), Primal (cyan), Black (white)
- Exposes `TotalBeasts.IsAllowedBeastNearby(int range)` via Plugin Bridge for other plugins to query

### Bestiary Panel Overlay
- Overlays **price badges** on every captured beast slot in the Bestiary UI
- Prices fetched automatically from **poe.ninja** (configurable refresh interval)
- Shows prices on captured beast items in **inventory** and **stash**
- Optional highlight frame on selected (tracked) beasts

### Automation
- Automatically **itemizes** beasts worth ≥ *X chaos* and **releases** the rest
- Configurable **Itemize Yellow Beasts** toggle (independent of chaos threshold)
- Stops automatically when **inventory is full** or when the **Bestiary panel is closed**
- Only acts on beasts visible in the current scroll viewport — never clicks off-screen slots
- Waits for server confirmation before the next action (no double-clicks)
- Hotkey to toggle automation on/off without opening settings
- **Status badge** in the Tracker window: "● Automation in progress..." while running, "✓ Automation completed" (with fade-out) after it stops

### Human-like Input
- **Perlin noise** position jitter — click positions vary smoothly, avoiding pixel-perfect patterns
- **Min/max random delay** between actions (configurable range)
- **Pre-click settle delay** — simulates reaction time between cursor arriving and clicking
- Mouse travels directly from last button to next button, no intermediate moves
